### Starting the game: ‚ñ∂

* Load the map with either `"load Simple.map"` or `"load Advanced.map"` command.

### Info on the game: ‚Ñπ

First information: You are a character and have to escape dungeons where there is gold and monsters! Play the levels to escape!

Aim: This is a Dungeon Crawler made for the Command Line/ Powershell. Move the character, represented by an '@', starting on a 'S', by using the WASD keys and make your move around the map without crashing into walls '#' and battling with Monsters! 'M' by using the SPACEBAR key and picking up pieces of gold 'G' by pressing E key.

Gameplay

## Edits of code: üìì

* 08/01/2021 - Fixed code so it passes all tests in Powershell and Visual Studio and changed the UI to look more appealing.
* 11/01/2021 - Fixed loading bug with the advanced map under new execution phase and loading it in after typing 'play' and polished the reset of variable on the replay feature.
* 12/01/2021 - Fixed bugs that messed with tests, although gold pickup doesn't work if you're on it, only works if you're next to it and updated user interface.
* 13/01/2021 - Fixed attack action where .Trim() would remove the ' ' and then replace it with no empty space so it wouldn't register attacking the monster.
* 14/01/2021 - For now if you move over the 'G' it will automatically increment gold counter but pickup stills works if next to the gold and pressing E, also ammended comments.
